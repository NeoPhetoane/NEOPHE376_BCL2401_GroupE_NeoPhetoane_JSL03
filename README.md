### Overview

This project consisted of two recipes for cooking steak. One is imperative and the other declarative and the challenge was to figure out which one was which.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

The theory: In theory, I understand very well that an imperative paradigm focuses on the process of achieving a goal and declarative strictly focuses on what needs to be achieved.

#### Challenges Faced

This was by far, the most difficult challenge I have encountered, since learning to code.

Telling code apart: Despite knowing the difference between the two paradigms, I struggled to see which one was actually which. They both seemed imperative to me as they had detailed steps to follow.

What elements determine the paradigm: So far I understand that arrays are one property that declare a code to be declarative, but I do not know the rest. The two paradigms seem to all have conditional statements and loops even though they may slightly vary

#### Areas for Improvement

Telling the codes apart: I definitely need to practise more on what properties constitute an imperative and/or a declarative code.

Vocalising my thoughts: I sometimes struggle with presentations even when I understand the logic behind my work. I tend to see the logic in my head but struggle to articulate myself well.

#### Overall Learning Experience

Although this project was very challenging, it offered me a chance to go back and try different ways to find information that I can easily digest. I also realised that the two paradigms will almost always coexist. Code may be predominantly one paradigm but it will always include the other.
